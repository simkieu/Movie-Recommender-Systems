The SVD algorithm is implemented in both Python and Matlab. You can choose either to get the result.
When running Python, result will be saved in csv file and can be opened and plotted with Microsoft Excel.
When running Matlab, result will be save in a mat file and can be plot by using the existing commands in 'plot_rmse.m'
The original data file downloaded from MovieLens Group at:
http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip
In order to get the 100,000 rating data files, pick the first 100,000 ratings from the original data set.
The 100,000 dataset is named '_data.csv'. Make sure this file is in the Matlab folder, if you want to run with Matlab.
If not, it can be easily generated by runnin the python code 'main.py' in 'Python' folder.
Our analysis is based on the Python results.

PYTHON CODES (PREFERRED, can be run with original data file 10M)

Makes sure you have data original data file '_data.csv' in the folder with 'main.py'

Run file 'main.py' with Python 3

Set the parameters for 'fold_set' and 'k_set' in the section '# Set parameters', and run it.

Output result is a matrix where each row represents RMSE for each number of folds. Each column represents the 
RSME for each k-dimension. 

Result will be printed out and also be saved in '_rmse.csv'

*Optional: Results can be plotted by open the output file in Microsoft Excel and manually plot it.

============================================================================================================

MATLAB CODES (must be run if we have the 100,000 ratings dataset '_data.csv')

'_data.csv': Choose the first 100,000 ratings from original dataset

Run 'main.m' to get results.

Results are saved in the matrix rmse, where each row is for each fold, each colum is for each dimension we reduce to.

*Optional: Use 'plot_rmse.m' to plot the RMSE lines. You might need to choose the commands from the set of existing 
commands to have the plot you want to see.
